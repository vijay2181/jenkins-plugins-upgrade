## Prerequisites

- Jenkins Administrator Access
- Backup and Restore Knowledge
- Basic Understanding of Jenkins Plugins

## Best Practices

1. **Backup Jenkins Configuration and Data**
    - Before making any changes, always take a backup of your Jenkins home directory.
    - Use Jenkins' built-in backup plugins like ThinBackup or perform a manual backup.

2. **Review Plugin Compatibility**
    - Check the compatibility of the plugins with your current Jenkins version.
    - Review the changelog of each plugin to understand the new features and potential breaking changes.

3. **Test in a Staging Environment**
    - Always test plugin updates in a staging or test environment before applying them to production.
    - Ensure that all critical jobs and configurations work as expected after the upgrade.

4. **Upgrade Plugins One at a Time**
    - Avoid upgrading multiple plugins simultaneously.
    - Upgrade one plugin, verify its functionality, and then proceed with the next. This helps in isolating issues if they arise.

5. **Monitor Jenkins Logs**
    - After upgrading each plugin, monitor the Jenkins logs for any errors or warnings.
    - Address any issues immediately to prevent cascading problems.

6. **Plan for Downtime**
    - Schedule upgrades during maintenance windows or periods of low activity.
    - Inform your team about the planned upgrade to minimize disruptions.

## Step-by-Step Upgrade Process

### 1. Backup Jenkins

```sh
# Example command for manual backup
tar -czvf jenkins_backup_$(date +%F).tar.gz $JENKINS_HOME
```

Or use ThinBackup plugin:

1. Go to **Manage Jenkins** > **ThinBackup**
2. Click on **Backup Now**

### 2. Review Plugin Compatibility

- Go to the [Jenkins Plugin Index](https://plugins.jenkins.io/) and search for each plugin.
- Check the compatibility and changelog.

### 3. Test in Staging

- Clone your production Jenkins environment to a staging setup.
- Apply the plugin upgrades in staging and verify functionality.

### 4. Upgrade Plugins

1. Go to **Manage Jenkins** > **Manage Plugins**.
2. Navigate to the **Updates** tab.
3. Select the plugin to upgrade and click **Download now and install after restart**.

### 5. Verify Functionality

- After Jenkins restarts, test critical jobs and configurations.
- Monitor Jenkins logs for any issues:

```sh
tail -f $JENKINS_HOME/logs/jenkins.log
```

### 6. Repeat for Each Plugin

- Upgrade each plugin one by one, repeating the verification process.

### 7. Post-Upgrade Tasks

- Verify that all jobs are running as expected.
- Check for any deprecations or warnings in the Jenkins console.

### 8. Rollback if Necessary

- If any issues arise, use the backup to restore Jenkins to its previous state.

```sh
# Example command for manual restore
tar -xzvf jenkins_backup_<backup_date>.tar.gz -C $JENKINS_HOME
```

Or use ThinBackup plugin:

1. Go to **Manage Jenkins** > **ThinBackup**
2. Click on **Restore** and select the appropriate backup.

## Conclusion

Following these best practices ensures a smooth and fail-proof Jenkins plugin upgrade process. Always prioritize testing and backups to mitigate risks.

### some suggestions

```
 What you should do:

    Separate development and production environments

    All your Jenkins config (including plugins and their config) stored as code, 
    ideally built as some kind of immutable image and run as a container in some HA K8S or similar cluster

    Do a trial run of the upgrade in a staging area, running through a series of 
    operability checks (trial builds of your code base, areas identified as problematic in the past due to dependencies on other services or similar).

    Once all is proven, initiate a rolling update, ideally off-hours to minimize interim impact (though if you've set things up right, it shouldn't matter).

    If there are problems, roll back to the previous set of images.

```
